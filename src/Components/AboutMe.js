            <h3>Former experience designer applying user experience design kills to create unique user touch points that give the user a memorable, valuable experience.</h3>
            <p>Growing up, I always thought my dream was to be an event planner. Planning extravagant get togethers for big Hollywood stars. This only seemed appropriate given my BA in Experience Design and Management. While I was searching for a job in this field, I felt just “meh”. I couldn’t find my spark. <br/> During my job search I came across Lambda School, and that’s when I caught fire. Web development calls to all my passions. It allows me to use my creativity an my problem solving skills simultaneously to produce beautiful work. <br/> I love applying responsive web design principles and watching my web pages shrink into a mobile screen and still look amazing. In a way I think I’m kind of like those web pages; I’m moldable, but I still keep my creative juices intact. <br/> ’m still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming, frameworks, or skills I can integrate into my current skill set.</p>
